// In order to use .def files to freeze code you must use one or more DEFFILE lines;
// see the ones commented out below for examples.
// By default, the build tools look for the WINSCW def file in a BWINS directory
// (at the same level as the directory containing the mmp file), 
// the GCC ARM def file in a BMARM directory, and the ARMV5 def file in a EABI directory. 
// If your .def files are stored in these default locations, you can simply specify the
// .def filename(s) with no path. If you want to store .def files in non-default 
// locations, you will need to specify the paths in the DEFFILE statement(s).

//The following commented out code shows how the build system uses the implicit
// location for defiles. To create the DEF files Choose Project > Freeze Exports from Carbide
// or run 'abld freeze' from the command-line
//#ifdef MARM
DEFFILE ../eabi/toolsstarterclient.def
//#endif
